# odin-landing-page

This Odin project involves creating a structured landing page using HTML and CSS, focusing specifically on layout design with Flexbox. Through the development of the page, I've gained a deeper understanding of how to effectively use Flexbox to create responsive layouts and manage the positioning of elements.
